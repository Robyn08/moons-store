            <p>Hello! I'm a web developer living in Fort Smith, Arkansas.</p>
            <p>I make it my personal mission to complete projects properly the first time.</p>
            <p>I've always had an interest in computers and started learning how to code in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>I have other projects that focuses on graphic design including virtual reality avatar and world creation for VRCHAT.</p>
            <p>I'm a very creative person and I hope to have all my creations added to this website soon!</p>
